Years ago I worked almost exclusively in Microsoft Access and automating Microsoft Office.  Being a programmer I eventually became a "guru" in Classes and object oriented programming in Access.  Most serious VBA programmers quickly learn about libraries and modules, but far fewer learn the intricacies of classes, and fewer still in how to sink and source events in your own classes.  This is an attempt to document VBA modules and in particular classes and Events.
